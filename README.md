# Annual Sales Report 2022 - Clothing Store (Excel Dashboard)

This project presents a comprehensive “Sales Analysis Dashboard” for a clothing store using Microsoft Excel. The primary objective was to analyze sales performance in 2022 and identify key insights to strategize and boost sales in 2023.

## Project Objective:

To help the clothing store understand their customer behavior, sales trends, and major contributors to sales in 2022 using Excel visualizations. The goal is to support data-driven decisions to increase sales in the coming year.

 1. Data Cleaning
Performed basic cleaning operations within Excel:
- Changed data types (e.g., date, number, text)
- Removed null values
- Standardized values in columns like `Gender` and `Quanta`

2. Data Processing
Created new columns for analysis:
Age Bucket: Categorized customers into `Teenagers`, `Adults`, and `Seniors` using `IF` conditions.
Month Extract: Used the `TEXT` function to extract the month name from the date for monthly comparisons.

3. Data Analysis & Visualizations
Created interactive visualizations using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and other chart types in Excel:
- Sales vs Orders (Line Chart): Monthly comparison of total sales amount and number of orders
- Sales by Gender (Pie Chart): Breakdown of sales percentage by men and women
- Order Status (Pie Chart): Distribution of order statuses – Delivered, Returned, Refunded, Canceled
- Top 5 States (Bar Chart): States contributing the most orders
- Age vs Gender (Stacked Bar Chart): Distribution of orders by age bucket and gender
- Sales by Channel (Column Chart): Comparison of sales contribution from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra

## Key Insights:
Women accounted for 65% of total purchases — indicating higher female engagement.

Adults (ages 39–49) made up 50% of total sales, making them the highest-contributing age group.
